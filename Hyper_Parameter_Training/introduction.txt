Types of Parameters 
1. Model Parameters
2. Hyper Parameters

Model parameters 
are the parameters of the model that can be determined by training with
training dataset . These can be considered as internal parameter. These parameters 
are determined from the execution of the model parameters . 
ex. weights , bias 
Y = w*X + b



Hyperparameters
are the parameters whose values control the learning process .These are adjustable paramters 
used to obtain an optimal model . These are external parameters .These are not determined
rather these are used in the learning process .
ex. learning rate , Number of Epochs , n_estimators 

 

Model + Hyperparameter tuning -> Best Hyperparameters
Model + Model Training -> Best Model Parameters


Hyperparameter tuning
This refers to the process of choosing the optimium set of Hyperparameters
for a Machine Learning Model . This process is also called Hyperparamter Optimization.

This is of two types -> GridSearchCV , RandomisedCV

GridSearchCV
This is an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. 
It is a cross-validation method to find the optimal hyperparameters by trying all
possible combinations of the provided hyperparameter values.

RandomizedSearchCV
This method samples a fixed number of hyperparameter settings from the specified 
hyperparameter space. It is a more efficient approach compared to GridSearchCV when 
the hyperparameter space is large, as it does not try all possible combinations but 
rather a random subset of them.


Hyperparameters Machine supports Vector Classifiers
C:[1,5,10]
kernel:['linear' , 'poly' , 'rbf' , 'sigmoid']

C values are for misclassification , if large then we are allowing many misclassifications
